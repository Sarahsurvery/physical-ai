🧠 Chapter 4: AI Brain & Decision Making

The AI brain is the decision-making system of a robot. It processes sensor data, analyzes situations, and decides what action to take.

The AI brain typically includes:

Machine learning models

Rule-based logic

Planning algorithms

Control systems

Decision making in Physical AI must be:

Fast (real-time)

Safe

Reliable

For example:

A humanoid robot decides how to avoid obstacles while walking.

A robotic arm decides how much force to apply while picking an object.

Modern AI brains use deep learning, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic reasoning to improve performance over time.
