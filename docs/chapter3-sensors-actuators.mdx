🔧 Chapter 3: Sensors & Actuators

Sensors and actuators are the foundation of Physical AI systems.

Sensors

Sensors allow robots to sense the environment. They act like human senses.

Common sensors include:

Cameras (vision)

Microphones (hearing)

Temperature sensors

Pressure sensors

Distance sensors (LiDAR, ultrasonic)

Sensors convert physical signals into digital data that AI systems can process.

Actuators

Actuators allow robots to take action in the physical world.

Examples:

Motors

Hydraulic systems

Robotic arms

Wheels and joints

Together, sensors and actuators form a sense–think–act loop, which is essential for intelligent robotic behavior.
