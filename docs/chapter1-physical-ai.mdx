
📘 Chapter 1: Physical AI Basics

Physical Artificial Intelligence (Physical AI) refers to intelligent systems that can perceive, think, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI, which mostly works in software (such as chatbots or recommendation systems), Physical AI is embedded in machines and robots that interact with real environments.

Physical AI combines:

Artificial Intelligence

Robotics

Sensors

Actuators

Control systems

Examples of Physical AI include:

Industrial robots in factories

Autonomous vehicles

Delivery drones

Smart medical robots

The goal of Physical AI is to enable machines to understand their surroundings and make decisions in real time. These systems must deal with uncertainty, noise, and physical constraints, which makes Physical AI more complex than purely digital AI.
